Switch Sort
Have the function SwitchSort(arr) take arr which will be an an array consisting of integers 1...size(arr) and determine what the fewest number of steps is in order to sort the array from least to greatest using the following technique: Each element E in the array can swap places with another element that is arr[E] spaces to the left or right of the chosen element. You can loop from one end of the array to the other. For example: if arr is the array [1, 3, 4, 2] then you can choose the second element which is the number 3, and if you count 3 places to the left you'll loop around the array and end up at the number 4. Then you swap these elements and arr is then [1, 4, 3, 2]. From here only one more step is required, you choose the last element which is the number 2, count 2 places to the left and you'll reach the number 4, then you swap these elements and you end up with a sorted array [1, 2, 3, 4]. Your program should return an integer that specifies the least amount of steps needed in order to sort the array using the following switch sort technique.

The array arr will at most contain five elements and will contain at least two elements.
